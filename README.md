# Neural-Localizer-Fields-NLF-pytorch-demo  

This is pytorch version implementation for ""Neural Localizer Fields for Continuous 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation"", the implementation allows SMPLX visualization and OBJ mesh output (only detect one human in each frame).  
  
Please download the SMPLX model here: https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/  
  
- Git clone the NLF original repo: https://github.com/isarandi/nlf.git  
- Put this pytorch implementation code inside the repo  
- Place the SMPLX model inside the repo  
- Pick your own picture example
- Run the demo.py, it will output one image and one obj file
- Run the demo_pkl.py, and then run the demo_rendering.py, it will output pkl file and also animation video  
  
If you find the code useful, feel free to star!
