# Neural-Localizer-Fields-NLF-pytorch-demo  

This is pytorch version implementation for ""Neural Localizer Fields for Continuous 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation"", the implementation allows SMPLX visualization and OBJ mesh output.  
  
Please download the SMPLX model here: https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/  
  
- Git clone the NLF original repo: https://github.com/isarandi/nlf.git  
- Put this pytorch implementation code inside the repo  
- Place the SMPLX model inside the repo  
- Pick your own picture
- Run the demo.py
